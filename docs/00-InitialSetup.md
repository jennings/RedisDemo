Initial Setup
==============

The first step just gets a new MVC project up and running, without any database.

This MVC project runs in IIS Express on port 8000. Right-click the project,
go to the Web section, and click "Create Virtual Directory".

Press F5. You should see the welcome page.

Congratulations!
